## World-Database-App- Assessment of Revenue Tool

This app is designed to provide a cross-country comparison snapshot of rates and revenue indicators across 20 years for over 120 countries. By allowing users to benchmark composition and efficiency of tax revenues to a group of country and country group comparators, ART provides information for tax policy assessment and helps identify potential areas for revenue mobilization and to increase revenue collection efficiency. The World Revenue Longitudinal database (WoRLD) used in this tool, contains revenue information curated from four sources: the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics (GFS) and World Economic Outlook (WEO) and the OECD’s Revenue Statistics and Revenue Statistics. The International Tax Rates Database (ITRD) on the other hand, is predominantly sourced from IBFD, EY, KPMG tax guides.
