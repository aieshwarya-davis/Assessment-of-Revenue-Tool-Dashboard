# World-Database-Dashboard

This repository is dedicated to design an R Shiny App for the World Revenue Longitudinal Database dashboard.

The r code contains the ui and server code to construct the app and the respository also contains the WoRLD database that is externally available through IMF data. 

The goal is for the dashboard to show country specific trends of each revenue indicator and for it to also have cross country comparison (if possible)




#Bottlenecks

Unable to get the server to interact and produce the plot. 
Would like multi country select trends in the plot but with a cap of only 5 countries at a time. 
Would also like a year range selector
