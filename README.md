## World-Database-App

This repository is dedicated to design an R Shiny App for the World Revenue Longitudinal Database- https://aieshdavis.shinyapps.io/World_vizapp/

The r code contains the ui and server code to construct the app and the respository also contains the WoRLD database produced by the IMF.  


This app shows a snapshot of a country's 13 revenue indicators across 20 years and in comparison to over 200 countries. These indicators are from four sources: the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics (GFS) and World Economic Outlook (WEO) and the OECD’s Revenue Statistics and Revenue Statistics.
